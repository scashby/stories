"Where did you go?" Oliver didn't look up from his phone, though he did tilt his head in the direction of the door. Julie took off her coat and kicked off her shoes, tossed her keys into the dish by the door and walked into the kitchen. Oliver could hear her take a glass out of the cabinet, the clink of three ice cubes, and knew the silence that followed was the bourbon pouring into the glass.

"Where did you go?" Oliver repeated when she came back into the room.

"I told you."

"I forgot."

"You always forget. You weren't listening in the first place."

"It was something about your mother's, right?"

"That was last week."

"Oh."

Oliver stood up and got a beer from the fridge. "I brought home take out," he said after it got silent again.

"I saw. I ate at work."

"Is it Tuesday?"

"Yes."

"I thought it was Wednesday."

"I know."

"Are they letting people sit at the bar yet?"

"Not yet. They're supposed to put up plexiglass later this week."

"Like a sneeze guard?"

"Yeah."

"Think that'll help?"

"Maybe. I can't see it."

"It's weird."

"Yeah."

"You should try the Philly rolls."

"I ate already."

"Yeah, I know. They're really good."

"Ok. Maybe later."
